# üß† CloudWatch Multi-Region EC2 & ELB Monitoring ‚Äì Architecture Guide

This document explains the technical design and structure of the CloudWatch monitoring dashboard created for observing EC2 and ELB performance across multiple AWS regions and accounts.

---

## üîß Design Objectives

- Centralize EC2 & ELB observability in one dashboard
- Enable quick region switching via dynamic variables
- Surface alarms with clear thresholds and anomaly detection
- Provide alerting via SNS email subscriptions
- Maintain dashboard extensibility for future regions or services

## üì¶ Stack Overview

| Component     | Purpose                                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **CloudWatch Dashboard** | Main interface for real-time monitoring |
| **CloudWatch Alarms**    | Resource usage alerts with thresholds and anomaly detection |
| **SNS Topic**            | Sends email alerts for triggered alarms |
| **Property Variables**   | Allow dashboard-wide filtering by instance, load balancer, and region |
| **CWAgent**              | Publishes RAM and disk metrics not included by default |

## üìà Metrics Monitored

### üîπ EC2
- `CPUUtilization` (AWS/EC2)
- `mem_used_percent` (CWAgent)
- `disk_used_percent` (CWAgent)
- `NetworkIn` / `NetworkOut` (AWS/EC2)

### üîπ ELB (Application Load Balancer)
- `RequestCount`
- `ActiveConnectionCount`
- `HTTPCode_ELB_4XX_Count`
- `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count`

---

## üö® Alarm Strategy

Alarms were defined in **three formats**:
- CloudFormation (YAML and JSON)
- AWS CLI (`put-metric-alarm`)

### üîî Alarm Features:
- Static threshold alarms (e.g., NetworkIn > 281MB)
- Anomaly detection alarms (e.g., disk usage outside expected pattern)
- Alert routing via SNS topic: `cloudwatch-observability-alarm-topic`

### Example:
```yaml
AlarmName: sg-prod-backend-high-network-in-percent-alarm
Metric: NetworkIn
Threshold: 281250000
Period: 300 (5 min)
Evaluation: 2 datapoints
Alert Channel: SNS email

üì¨ Email Alert Flow

CloudWatch Alarm ‚ûù SNS Topic ‚ûù Email Subscriber

A sample SNS alert looks like:

```bash
Alarm Name: sg-production-backend-high-network-in-percent-alarm
Region: ap-southeast-1
State: ALARM
Metric: NetworkIn (AWS/EC2)
Threshold: > 281,250,000 bytes
Current value: 305,000,000 bytes
```

üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard UI Breakdown
Gauges: Current CPU, RAM, Disk metrics

Time Series: ELB performance and request/error rates

Alarm Panels: Current status per region

Text Widgets: User instructions & notes

Layout is built for clarity, allowing engineers to spot bottlenecks at a glance.

üîÑ Extensibility
Easily extend to support additional regions or services (e.g., RDS, Lambda)

Add more variables (e.g., Environment, AppName) as needed

Dashboards can be exported and version-controlled as JSON

‚úÖ Lessons Learned
CloudWatch variables are powerful but require careful dimension matching

SNS is a simple and effective notification channel

Anomaly detection adds context to thresholds and reduces false positives

Always export working dashboards to avoid overwriting issues
